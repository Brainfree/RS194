Known problems:
    Hotkeys are activated no matter what, which means typing in the search activates them too. Fix it future me.

Need to rewrite:
    MapPanel needs some sweeping, it's starting to look like a hoarders home.

Future features:
    Place/remove locations
    Easy adjustments to the heightmaps
    Preview box for Items/Locations/NPC/Floors/Tile Shapes!
